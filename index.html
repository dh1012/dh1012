  <h2>manchurian</h2>
	<p>Vegetable Manchurian is an Indo-Chinese food. It is an exotic dish made of mixed vegetable steamed formed into dumplings deep fried and cooked in a tangy sauce. It uses very simple ingredients, does involve a bit of chopping and preparation but the final dish is well worth the effort! This vegetarian Manchurian is one of the best examples of fusion food. There are two versions of Vegetable Manchurian, wet and dry. Made with generous amount of garlic and ginger, flavored with soy sauce and vinegar, the wet Vegetable Manchurian (with gravy) complements Rotiâ€™s and is best when drizzled on a serving of steaming hot rice, fried rice or noodles.</p></div>
